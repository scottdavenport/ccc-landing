import { toast } from 'sonner';  // This shows pretty messages when we upload images

// This is our special sponsor upload area! ðŸŽ¨
// It's like a special photo frame where we can put sponsor logos

  // It has two parts: public_id (like a name tag) and secure_url (where to find it)

  // It's like getting a new photo and putting it in our photo frame
